# Sandy's Mapsite
This project is called "Sandy's Mapsite" and it's a place to pin and save locations on a map of the world. I would like for this to eventually become a more useful application (with a search bar and ability to write notes on the pins, etc). It has also been a way for me to practice developing with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. Frontend has been styled with Bootstrap. Deployed with Heroku at https://sandysmapsite.herokuapp.com/.

# To Do
Want to add more functionality to map - have search bar, name of location on pin markers. Would like to learn how to test React frontend well and need to fix issue with map routing.
